# Virtual_paint
The virtual paint application is built using OpenCv. 
It demonstrates identification of color and then using that color to draw it on the screen. This happens in real time and is actually a fun project to work.

# Steps to follow:
1. Install opencv-python
2. Install numpy
3. Install matplotlib

# How it works:
Basically it works by identifying the color using HSV methods. Once we have 2 or 3 colors, their HSV values are send into a list. So when the app detects the HSV values of those colors they appear and with opencv methods like draw_circle, it helps to draw and play around in real time.
